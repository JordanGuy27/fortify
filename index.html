            Brad is the founder of Fortify Strength & Performance. He graduated from Brock University with a bachelor of Physical
            Education Degree (honours) and obtained a Post-Graduate Certificate in Exercise Science for Health and Performance from
            Niagara College. He is currently certified with the National Strength and Conditioning Association as a Strength and
            Conditioning Specialist. He also holds the gold standard in exercise science as a Certified Exercise Physiologist
            through the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad brings his passion and dedication for training every time he steps out onto the training floor. He sets an example
            for the effort and intensity he wants his athletes to be training at. His goal is to have his athletes feel empowered
            and believe in their own potential so that they can be the best version of themselves. He believes that the key to any
            great training regimen is bringing focus, work ethic and the attitude to get better every single day. He instills this
            in his athlete’s day in and day out because at the end of the day, these characteristics are the foundation of great,
            successful people.

              Building athletic foundations is what we do. Our mission is to assess the Athlete as a whole, develop their
              limitations/weaknesses from the ground up and challenge their abilities to stimulate success. We are extremely
              passionate about developing and improving athleticism in our athletes so that they are stronger, faster, more powerful
              and less prone to sport related injuries. We are relentlessly driven to provide proven training methods based on the
              most up-to-date and leading scientific research to ensure each Athlete in our family is fortified strong.

              Fortify Strength & Performance creates very precise athletic training programs, covering every critical aspect about
              the Athlete. The programming is specific to the Athlete’s current season (in-season, off-season, pre-season), sport,
              position, age, gender, biological development, and even their anatomical make up. We break down every component
              including strengthening common sport-related injury sites and improving common movement faults through joint stability
              and mobility. We challenge our Athlete’s strength, speed and power through progressive overload techniques, in order to
              create an appropriate stimulus to generate greater adaptations.
